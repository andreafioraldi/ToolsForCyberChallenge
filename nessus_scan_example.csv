occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

vulnerability.","The version of Samba, a CIFS/SMB server for Linux and Unix, running on
the remote host is affected by a flaw, known as Badlock, that exists
in the Security Account Manager (SAM) and Local Security
Authority (Domain Policy) (LSAD) protocols due to improper
authentication level negotiation over Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
channels. A man-in-the-middle attacker who is able to able to
intercept the traffic between a client and a server hosting a SAM
database can exploit this flaw to force a downgrade of the
authentication level, which allows the execution of arbitrary Samba
network calls in the context of the intercepted user, such as viewing
or modifying sensitive security data in the Active Directory (AD)
database or disabling critical services.","Upgrade to Samba version 4.2.11 / 4.3.8 / 4.4.2 or later.","http://badlock.org

in one or more cipher suites. It is, therefore, affected by a
vulnerability, known as SWEET32, due to the use of weak 64-bit block
ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker who has sufficient resources can
exploit this vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret and a known
plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the secret text, such as secure
HTTPS cookies, and possibly resulting in the hijacking of an
authenticated session.

Proof-of-concepts have shown that attackers can recover authentication
cookies from an HTTPS session in as little as 30 hours.

Note that the ability to send a large number of requests over the
same TLS connection between the client and server is an important
requirement for carrying out this attack. If the number of requests
allowed for a single connection were limited, this would mitigate the
vulnerability. However, Nessus has not checked for such a mitigation.","Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of all
64-bit block ciphers. Alternatively, place limitations on the number
of requests that are allowed to be processed over the same TLS
